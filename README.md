My project involves developing a web app designed to facilitate the buying and selling of secondhand items. It aims to simplify the listing process for sellers, enhance item discoverability for buyers, all while promoting sustainability through the reuse of goods.

Category: E-commerce with social networking features
Story: Users sign up for the app and create profiles to start selling and buying secondhand items. Sellers post items with photos and descriptions, while buyers browse listings using search and filter options. Users can like listings, creating a social community around secondhand shopping.
Market: This app is aimed at environmentally conscious consumers, primarily young adults and teens, who are interested in sustainable shopping and affordable secondhand items. It also targets niche collectors and fashion enthusiasts looking for unique and vintage items
Habit: Users are likely to use the app daily to browse new listings, engage with the community through likes and comments, and manage their own items for sale. Frequent notifications about new items and interactions will encourage regular engagement.
Scope: The initial scope of the app will cover listing and browsing secondhand items with photos and detailed descriptions. It will include features for user profiles, item search and filters,  notifications, and basic social interactions such as likes, comments, and follows. Out of scope for the initial launch will be video listings, advanced AI-driven recommendations.
